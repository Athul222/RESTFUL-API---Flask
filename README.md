## Usage

To run the project, use the following command:

1. Change directory(cd) to your current directory

```bash
   cd name_of_directory_where_you_cloned_this_procject
```

2. To start the project

```bash

3. After running there might be no response shown to you. So you need to enter some data to the cafes.db(which will be automatically created when you run the program, which will be under the instance folder) according to its corresponding field.
